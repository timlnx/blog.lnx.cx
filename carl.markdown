This is Carl, he's 12 years old (13 in June, 2026), and he's a good boy.

He is *very mouthy* and loves to hang out.

Carl is a big fan of looking outside. In fact, he demands I leave the front door
cracked open in all seasons so he can watch critters and keep up with the
goings-on in the neighborhood. This year we were able to negotiate the winter
months with a temporary window perch in the same room (picture not available
yet).

Sometimes we watch the birbs at the birb feeder together.

Carl is a very large boi. The vet says his target weight should be about 13
pounds considering his impressive length.

Oh, hello!

![Carl is in your face](/assets/images/carl/oh-hello.jpg "Carl has no reservations about dominating you with his eyes")

He's a very active boy and likes to live dangerously. Here he is *living on the
edge*.

Sometimes when he's sleepy he falls asleep face down. What an adorable little
dingus (don't tell him I said that!)

Oh. My. Goodness. Look at that handsome little man. When we lay down at night he
will lay on my chest like this, demanding face rubs until he is satisfied.
