Find me on other assorted medias social.


I mostly post maker-project pictures on Instagram.

My vinyl record collection is on Discogs. There you can watch me throw my life
savings away on <b>more copies</b> of The Dark Side of the Moon in real time.

For actual thoughts your best bet used to be looking at at Bluesky, but I kinda
fell out of that. Might pick it up again. No promises.

1. Please observe that my old github account handle used to be `tbielawa`, I changed it in July 2025 and there will be old references out there. Repositories should auto forward to the renamed `timlnx` account
1. I used to post videos to my main google account youtube page (`TimBielawa`). I have created a new one separate from that old email address (see above). Videos will be there from now on.
