I'm not a huge audiophile, as far as financial investment goes, but the quest
for an excellent listening experience certainly qualifies as one of my special
interests.

On this page I've cataloged my whole setup.

{{ "Headphones" | blog_anchor }}

My headphone setup saw significant investment in 2023/2024. Expect some more
growth in this area in 2026.

{{ "ATH-WP900" | blog_anchor2 }}

The Audio Technica
[ATH-WP900](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/headphones/all/ath-wp900)'s are
my "in public" closed-back headphones. As a woodworker I was drawn to them.
They're a bit flashy and I like that. They are low impedance (38Ω) and are
easily driven by headphone jacks or basic DAC dongles.

They also support balanced output which is neat I guess. I want to say that I
can tell the difference, but to be honest, it's probably all in my head.

> IMAGE HERE W/ CARRY CASE

This carry case pattern is a design I came up with myself and have perfected
over the last few years. Many of my friends have received one of these as a
gift.

Would I buy them again? Certainly. But I don't suggest them as somebodies first
higher-end set of cans. You can get higher fidelity closed-backs for the same
price (or less). I paid $650.00 before taxes when I bought them in 2023. They
retail for $700 now on the AT website.

{{ "HD 560S" | blog_anchor2 }}

The Sennheiser [HD
560S](https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/p/hd-560s/ckyy9r5q0016i0c96sk5d9tog/)'s
are my open-back "I'm here for the listening experience" headphone. They're
higher impedance (120Ω) than the {{ "ATH-WP900" | blog_anchor_link }}'s and
benefit from a more powerful DAC to reach full volume.

> IMAGE HERE W/ CARRY CASE

They include a quarter-inch adapter which I often use when listening to old
records through the stereo for more intimate listening sessions.

They're mid-range priced cans ($230 when I bought them in 2023) that I would
recommend to somebody who is entering the high-fi audio hobby.

{{ "DAC" | blog_anchor }}

{{ "Questyle M15i" | blog_anchor2 }}

> This is my second DAC, see notes in {{ "Questyle M15" | blog_anchor_link }}
> (below) about why that is so

I first heard about the [M15i](https://questyleshop.com/products/questyle-m15i)
through [DMS](https://www.youtube.com/@DMS3TV) on YouTube in this video:

* [5 Pieces of underrated audio gear](https://youtu.be/eaWIC9r6dtI?t=71)

Which is reviewed in greater detail in a [dedicated
video](https://youtu.be/v5qenyVwumg) on [The Headphone
Show](https://www.youtube.com/@TheHEADPHONEShow) channel.

I like it.

* It is small
* It powers my {{ "HD 560S" | blog_anchor_link }}'s just fine
* It has a 4.4mm balanced output which my {{ "ATH-WP900" | blog_anchor_link }}'s can use
* It connects over USB-C
* It looks really nice
* It sounds great


{{ "Questyle M15" | blog_anchor2 }}

In 2023 I purchased the original M15 (no `i` suffix) model. It suffered some
damage so in January 2026 I looked up the [repair
options](https://questyleshop.com/pages/replace-refund-repair-policy). While I
was out of their 12 month warranty window, they still claimed to offer a paid
repair service:

> "The longer you use your device, the better for the planet and environment. If
> your device from Questyle is out of warranty yet needs repair, we offer our
> customers a paid repair service."

I emailed their support address, `hello@questyleshop.com` to find out what we
could do. They told me:

> "[...] We would be happy to repair it for you. However, if you ship the
> product to China, the shipping and customs fees will be very high, making it
> very uneconomical. Would you be interested in purchasing an M15i at a
> significant discount instead?

I said "yeah sure that sounds great to me". And to be honest, that sounded a lot
quicker, easier, and less tedious than shipping this overseas and dealing with
re-import costs.

The next day they got back to me with a $70 discount code. I applied it and
checked out only spending $109 on the newer model which retails for $300 as of
January, 2026 (marked down to $180 on their website at the time of writing).


{{ "Turntable" | blog_anchor }}

{{ "AT-LP120-USB" | blog_anchor2 }}

Way back in December 2017 I bought the venerable Audio Technica
[AT-LP120-USB](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/at-lp120-usb). This model
has been discontinued. I think I purchased it for around $250 at the time. It
looks like their closest available offering is the
[AT-LP120XUSB](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/turntables/type/usb/at-lp120xusb)
for $450.

I've digitized several albums with this turntable over the USB connection and
listened to countless hours of vinyl.

No complaints, but I wish it had an automatic tone-arm return function.

I pimped out my unit with a Dark Side of the Moon platter mat. Experts say this
adds exactly $0.00 in market value, but doubles my cool points.

{{ "VM540ML/H" | blog_anchor2 }}

In 2023, after years and years of play (6.5 years, 🫢) I replaced the
headshell/cartridge. This is normal maintenance for these devices which you
should do as described in your product manual.

The turntable ships with an elliptical
[ATN95E](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/atn95e) stylus in the box, which
is just fine (and economical at $52). I decided to take things to the next level
and I ordered the [VM540ML/H](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/vm540ml-h)
($300 before taxes in 2023) when I replaced mine.

This is a MicroLine® ("Micro-Ridge") shaped stylus which [The Ultimate Guide to
Styluses](https://thevinylverdict.com/ultimate-guide-to-styluses/) describes
like this:

> "At the top end of the stylus spectrum are micro-ridge or microline shapes.
> These ultra-precise tips closely mimic the shape of the cutting stylus used to
> create the original record grooves.
>
> ...
>
> "However, they are also the most expensive option and require very precise
> alignment and a high-quality turntable setup to realize their full potential."

That page also has a section on how long you can expect your stylus to last, and
how to increase the lifetime.

Am I getting the **full value** out of this 6x expensive stylus?

🤷🏼

Probably not. But it makes me feel good and gives me something to talk about.

{{ "Receiver/Speakers" | blog_anchor }}

{{ "AVR-591" | blog_anchor2 }}

I found the [Denon
AVR-591](https://www.denon.com/en-us/product/archive-av-receivers/avr-591/AVR591.html)
stereo receiver by chance one day while strolling through my favorite local
thrift store (for $30!). A quick [ebay
search](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=denon+avr-591&_sacat=32852&_odkw=Denon+AVR+591)
suggests that's still a good deal.

Originally released in May of 2010 with an MSRP of $350 this beast has
everything you could hope for at the time. For my little
[coach-house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_suite) setup it is more
than enough to shake the cabinets.
