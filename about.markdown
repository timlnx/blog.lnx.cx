# Oh, hi there!

This is the homepage of Tim Case. You might have known me as Tim Bielawa (or
Blablabla), or Shaggy back in the late aughts.

I'm just another geek from the GeoCities and Homestead era. Back then before
"blogging" we called it `e/n`, or everything/nothing. This place used to run on
WordPress, but I'm over all that extra work now.

I'm a philosophical naturalist. Think "atheist", except instead of defining my
belief structure by the absence of any theistic system, I define it by the
abundantly observable natural world around us.

> The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be (Carl Sagan)

He said it pretty well.

If you think I'm cool, you should check out [my cat](/carl/), he's a superstar.
