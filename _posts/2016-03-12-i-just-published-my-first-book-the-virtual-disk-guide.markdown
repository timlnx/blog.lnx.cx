I'm very excited (and proud) to announce that on March 3rd, 2016 I reached a [long-term goal](https://blog.lnx.cx/2012/08/29/on-long-term-goals/) I set for myself 3½ years ago, by self-publishing my first book, **The Linux Sysadmin's Guide to Virtual Disks**. The book is published under my new brand, [Scribe's Guides](http://scribesguides.com/).

The first edition of _The Virtual Disk Guide_ has been a long time coming. Nearly 7 years of on-and-off writing have gone into it. I'm relieved to have made it this far.

# About the Virtual Disk Guide


I view the book as _the definitive_ reference guide for virtual disk related activities — clear, concise, accurate, and approachable to readers of all skill levels— but that's just my opinion. You can decide that for yourself.

The book is **quite thoroughly** cited and annotated with nearly 100 individual footnotes and references to additional learning resources. The book weighs in at around 80 pages, 7 chapters, and two technical appendices. Here's the byline from the [scribesguides.com](http://scribesguides.com/) website:


<blockquote>_The Linux Sysadmin's Guide to Virtual Disks_ demonstrates the core concepts of virtual disk management. Real-world problems are covered in the book's "Cookbook" section. Other topics include: helper utilities, disk formats, troubleshooting tips, performance considerations, and comprehensive appendices.</blockquote>

# More Blog Posts Coming Soon


The experience of writing and publishing this book has taught me much, and it's time to spread that information. Check back soon for a follow-up post I'm writing which covers more of the technical side of self-publishing. Specifically, self-publishing a [DocBook 5](http://docbook.org/tdg51/en/html/) document at the on-demand printing website lulu.com.

Let me be explicitly clear, this is **not** a promotion for lulu.com.

Rather, the post will review some of the technical challenges I encountered (old examples: #[1](https://blog.lnx.cx/2013/01/21/working-on-the-virtual-disk-guide/), #[2](https://blog.lnx.cx/2013/06/23/update-using-ttf-fonts-with-docbook-and-dblatex/), #[3](https://blog.lnx.cx/2013/03/27/dblatex-docbook-acknowledgements-and-pdf-output/)) during the publishing process, including challenges specific to Lulu. Such as, how I customized the PDF output from dblatex to look more personal and less generically academic, why I had to order three proof copies of the book before the cover matter printed in decent quality, and how to adjust your inner and outer page margins so there's a reasonable amount of whitespace between the spine/binding and the body text.

_I have a feeling that by the time I'm done with the blog posts I'm going to have written _another_ book of documentation about _how_ I wrote a book of documentation_
