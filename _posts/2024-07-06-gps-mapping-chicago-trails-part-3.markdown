This is part 3 in a series of blog posts where I am taking a deep dive into the
world of GPS mapping. In this part of the series we're going to wrap everything
up. I will have GPX files available for download and links to trails on Hiking
Project. [Click

part 2.

What happened with all that GPS data and the messy trails? I talked with some
friends about it and they suggested reaching out to someone official who can
answer with authority about the situation. Primarily I needed to focus on
answering the question "is there an intended route through this forest?"


I reached out to the people at the Forest Preserve of Cook County:

>  or identifiers, and if there are any intended routes.

> Specifically region bordered on the North and South by Irving Park Road and

A few days later I received a brief response which did not directly answer any
of my questions.

I wasn't satisfied with this response so I probed further.

> * Does all this mean that the trails in Schiller Woods South aren't official then?
> * Do you have any official records or documentation of the myriad trails down there?
> * These trails do exist, but just aren't documented. What does that mean about their protected or maintenance status?

After a few days went by I bumped the email thread and this time I received a
much more complete response. The answers were not the ones I had hoped to
receive.

I enjoy this next part. It seems that the staff are unsure about those pretty
crap blazes I observed before:

In a followup response I provided a gallery of about 50 photos I took of all the
"not official markers" for their review.

The response continues:

> In conclusion, the only official trail running through this area is the yellow
> unpaved trail (part of the Des Plaines River Trail System) running north to

There you have it. Those trails are unofficial. Their use is discouraged, but
not prohibited.

{{ "But what about...?" | blog_anchor }}

I'm glad you asked. Because I'm curious about that too.

The response I got quoted a policy on their website (snippet...):

> Users of such trails, however, should note that the Forest Preserves does not
> inspect or maintain non-designated trails.

There is an actual bridge crossing over Schiller Brook, and people cross over
this bridge every day. Certainly there must be some kind of inspection happening
regularly to ensure the public safety. Is that maintenance?

Did you notice that little detail in the first deer photo I posted? You know the
detail I'm talking about, right? It's subtle, but it speaks volumes. I'm talking
about this detail:

![Trail Maintenance](/assets/images/sws-oh-dear-small-detail.jpg "Trail Maintenance")

A tree (or more likely, a large branch) fell there recently. There are still
leaves drying up on it (visible in the full photo shown earlier). And the fallen
branch has been cut by a human tool. The rest of the debris has been removed
from the trail.

I mentioned earlier that the data in OpenStreetMaps is associated with change
sets that are 14 years old. I'm sure before the {{ "Japanese Barberry" |
blog_anchor_link }} moved in this forest was much clearer and easier to
navigate. And certainly there has been considerable undergrowth in the decade+
since that data was acquired and documented.

Perhaps these paths were obvious shortcuts and bypasses to the
"unpaved yellow trail" (the "Des Plaines River Trail"). It would
explain a lot about their haphazard routes.
