Gave the Open Source Scholarship talk today with [@akbutcher](http://twitter.com/akbutcher). It was a smash hit. We were lucky to get a lot of great promotion around the internet for this event:



	
  * [WVU Today](http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2013/04/19/wvu-s-lane-department-to-announce-open-source-scholarship)

	
  * [OpenSource.com](http://opensource.com/education/13/4/open-source-scholarship)

	
  * A plethora of Twitter/G+/Facebook posts (27% of referrals)


I also want to give [Michael Dehaan](https://twitter.com/laserllama) a huge **thank you** for his cameo today. The students loved it!

The presentation is available online: [Open Source: A Guide](http://opensourcescholars.github.io/os-preso/). I was referring to it as our _self documenting presentation_, in that virtually everything Andrew and I touched on during the talk was linked from within the preso slides.

Thanks to all the students who came out (especially the folks who asked questions). We're doing this for you!
