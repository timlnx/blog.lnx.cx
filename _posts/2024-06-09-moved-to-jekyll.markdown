Greetings netizens. This site now runs on Jekyll. I am still working through
getting all of the old posts properly formatted with markdown. Some image links
are broken and need to be fixed too.

Oh, and all the old wordpress URLs need redirects setup to map to the new
content.

All in due time. Expect a post once this is settled.
